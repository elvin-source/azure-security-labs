# Azure Security Labs

This repository contains hands-on Azure security and governance labs focused on practical, real-world scenarios.

The labs cover core security domains including:
- Identity and access management
- Network security
- Secure compute and storage
- Monitoring and security operations
- Governance and risk controls

The goal of this repository is to document security design decisions, implementation steps, and lessons learned while working with Azure security services in environments with regulatory and compliance considerations.
